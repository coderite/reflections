When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  - Primarily when working on shared projects. A remote repo is also a good place to keep your work safe in case of hardware failure.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  - Someone else might make changes and push them to remote. Therefore, automatic pulls might inadvertently update your files before you had a chance to commit/push and or compare to what someone else pushed.
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 - Branches occur within a repository. Clones copy a repository locally or remotely. Forks are clones exclusively on the Github website.
 
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 - When you are offline for extended periods you can compare your work on the master branch to the locally stored remote branch.
 
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
 - Collaboration would be manual most likely (without if other version controls didn't exist. It would be much more difficult to accurately track changes. Life would slow to a stop. Code would explode. Git and Github must live on!!!
